# MNIST Neural Network Explorer

Welcome to our interactive platform for exploring neural network training and inference on the MNIST dataset. This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of machine learning fundamentals through:

- **Interactive visualization** of the training process
- **Real-time inference** on your own handwritten digits
- **Detailed analysis** of model performance and behavior
