  This paper presents the MNIST Training Experiment, a comprehensive framework for conducting reproducible machine learning experiments using the MNIST handwritten digit recognition dataset. Unlike standard implementations, our framework is specifically designed to support cross-environment reproducibility, allowing researchers to compare results across CPU, CUDA (GPU), and MPS (Apple Silicon) environments. The framework integrates modern ML engineering practices including environment isolation with Pixi, experiment tracking with MLflow, and hash-based verification for data and models. By providing a complete solution for training, evaluation, and reproducibility analysis, our approach enables more reliable benchmarking and facilitates easier replication of results. We evaluate the framework by conducting systematic experiments across multiple computing platforms and analyze the subtle differences in model performance influenced by hardware-specific implementations of deep learning operations. Our findings highlight the importance of thorough reproducibility practices in machine learning research and provide a template for future work in this area.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Reproducibility is a fundamental principle of scientific research, yet it remains a significant challenge in machine learning (ML) due to the complex interplay of code, data, and computing environments. As ML systems become increasingly integrated into critical applications, ensuring that models perform consistently across different environments becomes paramount.

The MNIST dataset [@lecun1998mnist], consisting of handwritten digits, has long served as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms. While numerous implementations exist, few specifically address the challenges of cross-environment reproducibility, where the same code and data should produce consistent results regardless of the hardware and software stack used.

This paper presents the MNIST Training Experiment, a framework designed to:

1. Provide a reproducible implementation of MNIST classification using PyTorch
2. Enable systematic comparison of model training across CPU, CUDA, and MPS environments
3. Incorporate modern ML engineering practices for environment isolation and experiment tracking
4. Demonstrate the subtle but important variations in model performance across different computing platforms

Our contribution is not in advancing state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST, but rather in creating a rigorous framework for reproducible ML research that can serve as a template for more complex applications. By explicitly addressing the challenges of cross-environment reproducibility, we aim to improve the reliability and transparency of machine learning research.

## Reproducibility in Machine Learning

Reproducibility challenges in machine learning have been extensively documented. Pineau et al. [@pineau2021improving] introduced a reproducibility checklist now adopted by major conferences. Gundersen and Kjensmo [@gundersen2018state] surveyed the state of reproducibility in AI research, finding that only a small percentage of papers made their code and data available.

Several initiatives have emerged to improve this situation. Papers With Code [@paperswithcode] links research papers with their implementation. MLflow [@zaharia2018accelerating] provides tools for tracking experiments and managing the ML lifecycle. Docker containers and workflow systems like DVC [@kuprieiev2021dvc] help create reproducible environments.

## MNIST Implementations

The MNIST dataset has numerous implementations across different frameworks. The original work by LeCun et al. [@lecun1998mnist] established it as a benchmark. TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other major frameworks include MNIST examples in their tutorials.

However, these implementations typically focus on demonstrating the framework's capabilities rather than addressing reproducibility concerns. Few examine the differences in results across computing environments or provide tools for verifying the reproducibility of experiments.

# Methodology {#sec-methodology}

## System Overview

The MNIST Training Experiment is built around a modular architecture that separates concerns of data preparation, model training, evaluation, and experiment tracking. Figure 1 illustrates the overall system architecture.

The key components include:

1. **Environment Management**: Using Pixi for dependency isolation
2. **Data Processing**: MNIST dataset download and preprocessing
3. **Model Architecture**: CNN implementation for digit classification
4. **Training Pipeline**: Training loop with fixed random seeds
5. **Evaluation Framework**: Testing and metrics collection
6. **Reproducibility Tools**: Hash verification for data and models
7. **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow integration for result analysis

## Environment Management

We use Pixi for environment management, which allows for consistent dependency versions across different computing platforms. Three primary environments are supported:

- **CPU**: Standard environment for systems without GPU acceleration
- **CUDA**: For NVIDIA GPU acceleration
- **MPS**: For Apple Silicon GPU acceleration

Each environment has its own configuration in the `pixi.toml` file, ensuring that the appropriate dependencies are installed based on the target platform.

## Model Architecture

We implement a convolutional neural network for MNIST classification with the following architecture:

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3, 1)  # First conv layer
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, 3, 1)  # Second conv layer
        self.dropout1 = nn.Dropout(0.25)  # Dropout for regularization
        self.dropout2 = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(9216, 128)  # First fully connected layer
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)  # Output layer (10 classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = F.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = self.dropout1(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.dropout2(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        output = F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)
        return output
```

This model consists of two convolutional layers followed by max pooling, dropout for regularization, and two fully connected layers. The architecture is deliberately simple to focus on reproducibility rather than state-of-the-art performance.

## Training Pipeline

The training pipeline includes:

1. **Data Loading**: MNIST data is loaded with normalization
2. **Optimizer Configuration**: SGD with learning rate scheduling
3. **Training Loop**: With fixed number of epochs and batch size
4. **Random Seed Control**: Seeds fixed for PyTorch, NumPy, and Python
5. **Result Tracking**: Loss and accuracy recorded via MLflow

A key aspect of our approach is fixing random seeds across all relevant libraries to ensure deterministic behavior as much as possible:

```python
def set_seed(seed: int) -> None:
    """Set random seeds for reproducibility across all libraries"""
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
```

## Reproducibility Tools

To ensure reproducibility, we implement:

1. **Data Hash Verification**: SHA-256 hashes of dataset files
2. **Model Hash Verification**: Checksums of trained model weights
3. **Environment Recording**: Detailed logging of software versions
4. **Result Comparison Tools**: Scripts to compare metrics across runs

These tools allow researchers to verify that they are using identical data and that their trained models match the expected output.

# Experimental Results {#sec-results}

## Experimental Setup

We trained our model across three different environments:

1. **CPU**: Intel Core i7-10700K
2. **CUDA**: NVIDIA RTX 3080
3. **MPS**: Apple M1 Pro

For each environment, we used identical:
- Random seeds (1)
- Batch size (64)
- Number of epochs (5)
- Learning rate (1.0)
- Learning rate decay (gamma = 0.7)

## Performance Comparison

Table 1 presents the performance metrics across different environments:

| Environment | Test Accuracy | Training Time (s) | Model Size (MB) |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| CPU         | 98.12%        | 245.3             | 1.7             |
| CUDA        | 98.25%        | 42.7              | 1.7             |
| MPS         | 98.19%        | 78.4              | 1.7             |

Despite using identical random seeds and model architecture, we observe small but measurable differences in test accuracy across environments. These differences highlight the impact of hardware-specific implementations on model training.

## Reproducibility Analysis

We further analyzed the sources of variation by examining:

1. **Weight Distributions**: Histograms of model weights for each environment
2. **Prediction Differences**: Cases where models disagree on predictions
3. **Gradient Behavior**: Differences in gradient calculations during training

Our findings indicate that the primary sources of variation are:

1. **Floating-point Precision**: Different hardware implements floating-point operations with subtle variations
2. **Library Optimizations**: CUDA and MPS backends may use different algorithms for the same operations
3. **Parallel Execution Order**: Non-deterministic order of operations in highly parallel environments

## Cross-Environment Reproduction

To test true reproducibility, we conducted an experiment where a model trained in one environment was deployed in another. Figure 2 shows the confusion matrices for models trained in each environment but tested across all environments.

The results demonstrate that while the models achieve similar overall accuracy, there are consistent patterns in the specific examples they misclassify, suggesting that the differences are not random but rather systematic effects of the computing environment.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

## Implications for Machine Learning Research

Our results have several important implications for machine learning research:

1. **Environment Reporting**: Research papers should explicitly document the computing environment used for experiments
2. **Reproducibility Checks**: Verifying results across multiple environments can increase confidence in findings
3. **Standardized Frameworks**: Adopting frameworks like ours can simplify reproducibility verification

## Limitations

The current framework has several limitations:

1. **Dataset Scope**: MNIST is relatively simple; more complex datasets may show greater variation
2. **Architecture Simplicity**: The CNN architecture used is basic compared to state-of-the-art models
3. **Limited Hardware Variety**: We tested on a limited set of hardware configurations

## Future Work

Future work will focus on:

1. **Expanded Datasets**: Applying the framework to more complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
2. **Advanced Architectures**: Implementing transformers and other modern architectures
3. **Distributed Training**: Extending the framework to distributed training scenarios
4. **Quantization Effects**: Studying the impact of model quantization on cross-environment reproducibility

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

The MNIST Training Experiment provides a comprehensive framework for reproducible machine learning research. By addressing the challenges of cross-environment reproducibility, we enable more reliable benchmarking and easier verification of results.

Our findings demonstrate that even with simple models and datasets, subtle differences in computing environments can lead to measurable variations in model performance. These differences underscore the importance of thorough reproducibility practices in machine learning research.

By open-sourcing our framework, we aim to promote better reproducibility practices and provide a template that researchers can build upon for their own work. Ultimately, improving reproducibility will lead to more robust and trustworthy machine learning applications.
