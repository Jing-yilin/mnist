# Welcome to the MNIST Data Exploration Project

This website is a tool for MNIST data exploration and model analysis created with Quarto. Here, we will:

- Explore the characteristics and distribution of the MNIST dataset
- Analyze trained model performance
- Visualize prediction results

## Project Overview

MNIST is a handwritten digit recognition dataset containing:

- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image
- 10 classes (digits 0-9)

## Navigation

- [Data Exploration](data-exploration.qmd): View statistical information and visual analysis of the MNIST dataset
- [Model Analysis](model-analysis.qmd): Analyze trained model performance and results

```{python}
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

print("Quarto and Python integration example")
```
